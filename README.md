# spi-_-slave-ram-
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol used to transfer data between a master (like a microcontroller) and one or more slave devices (like sensors, memory chips, or FPGAs).

SPI has 4 main signals:

SCLK: Serial Clock (from master)

MOSI: Master Out Slave In (data from master)

MISO: Master In Slave Out (data to master)

SS: Slave Select (active low)

A SPI slave is the receiving/responding device. It waits for the master to send clock and data signals, and it responds accordinglyâ€”either reading data or sending data back.

In this case, the SPI Slave is your custom logic (usually inside an FPGA or ASIC) that communicates with a master (e.g., a microcontroller).
